- 0.01ms duration override for reduced motion users

### Phase 10 - Responsive & Full Theme ✅

**Responsive layouts** ✅
- Mobile-first approach with xs: 360px breakpoint
- Side navigation → bottom navigation on mobile (MobileNav component)
- Dashboard layout with proper mobile spacing (pb-16 md:pb-0)
- Grid systems responsive across all breakpoints

**Tokenized theme variables** ✅
- Enhanced CSS custom properties in :root
- Responsive typography scale (mobile-first with media queries)
- Consistent spacing scale (--space-*)
- Shadow system (--shadow-*)
- Professional color scheme with blue primary (221 83% 53%)

**Theme toggle enhanced** ✅
- System theme sync with matchMedia API
- High contrast mode support
- Persistent user preferences in localStorage
- Visual feedback with check marks
- Smooth theme transitions without flash

**Typography scale per breakpoint** ✅
- Mobile: Smaller base sizes (0.9rem base)
- Tablet+: Standard sizes (1rem base)  
- Desktop+: Enhanced larger text
- CSS custom properties with responsive media queries
